Hi! I am Yanlin Wan, a fourth-year PhD candidate at the Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and at the Society Hub, HKUST (Guangzhou).

My research focuses on development economics and experimental economics. I employ economic experiments and causal inference methods to examine macro-level policy interventions and their micro-level impacts on individuals and society. Additionally, I explore effective strategies for engaging the target audience of public programs within the context of developing countries, particularly China and India.

My research trajectory includes the following three areas:

1. The impacts of technology policies on inequality
2. Behavioral determinants of citizen engagement in government initiatives
3. Experimental designs in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to promote student and workforce welfare

I am advised by Prof. Xu Zhang (xuzhang@hkust-gz.edu.cn) from HKUST (Guangzhou), Prof. Masaru Yarime (yarime@ust.hk) from HKUST, and Prof. Zihan Hu (zihanhu@smu.edu.sg) from Singapore Management University.
