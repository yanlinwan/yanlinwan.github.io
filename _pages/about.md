Hi! I am Yanlin Wan, a fourth-year PhD candidate at the Academy of Interdisciplianry Studies, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

My research focuses on development economics and experimental economics. I use experiments and causal inference methods to investigate the effects of policy interventions on individuals and communities. A key focus of my work is to identify effective strategies for engaging target audiences in public programs, particularly within developing countries in Asia.

My research trajectory includes the following three areas:

1. The impacts of technology policies on inequality
2. Behavioral determinants of citizen engagement in government initiatives
3. Experimental designs in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to promote student and workforce welfare

I am advised by [Prof. Xu Zhang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=3) (xuzhang@hkust-gz.edu.cn) from HKUST (Guangzhou), [Prof. Masaru Yarime](https://yarime.net) (yarime@ust.hk) from HKUST, and [Prof. Zihan Hu](https://www.zihanhuecon.com/) (zihanhu@smu.edu.sg) from Singapore Management University.
