## Working Papers 

**Nudge for Sanitation: Experimental Evidence from China**

(with Xu Zhang)

**Abstract**
Information provision has been suggested as a cost-effective approach to engaging the target poor in anti-poverty campaigns. However, empirical evidence shows that providing information about available public services or entitled rights alone is often insufficient to motivate behavior change. In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial experiment to compare the behavioral impacts of different informational nudges on villagers’ participation decisions in China’s Rural Toilet Revolution (RTR), which aims to boost rural development through improved living conditions. We designed six RTR advocacy videos as informational nudges based on local residents’ information demand, highlighting the benefits of RTR participation, the harms of poor sanitation, and techniques for toilet upgrades, either with or without a former RTR participant calling for engagement. Our findings suggest that any relevant policy information can induce a higher self-reported willingness to participate in RTR, while highlighting the benefits or harms is more effective in motivating long-term enrollment decisions. The results reveal the importance of engagement benefits for the target audience and highlight information barrier removal as a useful nudge to promote anti-poverty campaigns like RTR.

**Rewiring Opportunity: How Improved Internet Infrastructure Reduces Intra-City Income Inequality in China**

(with Xu Zhang, Yuzhi Hao, Aoqing Lyu, Masaru Yarime)

**Abstract**
This study investigates the impact of enhanced internet infrastructure on intra-city income inequality in China. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences methodology, our analysis reveals that the Broadband China Strategic Program from 2014 to 2016 resulted in a notable reduction in the income Gini coefficients of the demonstration cities, with substantial income gains among low- and middle-income households. We argue that the improved internet infrastructure mitigated income inequality mainly by creating new employment opportunities in the service sector for low-skilled workers. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of technology in fostering inclusive economic growth and provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to harness investments in internet infrastructure and improve social equality in developing countries.

**Exploring Risk Tolerance, Soft Skills, and Working Conditions across Informal Labor Markets in India**

(with Raja Rajendra Timilsina, Dil B Rahut, Tetsushi Sonobe, Kamal Chaudhary, Navneet Manchanda)

**Abstract**
The rise of the platform economy has segmented the informal labor market into digital and non-digital sectors. In policy discussions aimed at enhancing social protection for informal workers, there is often an emphasis on exploring the differences between these two groups, particularly in terms of labor market outcomes. However, these discussions have largely overlooked the role of individual traits and economic preferences. This paper investigates the differences in risk attitudes and soft skills between digital and non-digital workers through a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted in New Delhi, India. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in risk attitudes and soft skills across age demographics within digital and non-digital sectors. Specifically, younger non-digital workers demonstrate higher risk tolerance compared to their digital counterparts, while older workers exhibit a higher incidence of risk-neutral or risk-loving attitudes in the digital sector. Across age groups, digital workers show higher levels of self-control and openness but lower levels of grit and conscientiousness. We also identify a significantly negative correlation between risk tolerance and the likelihood of being a digital worker, particularly in the younger cohort. This study provides insights into policy design for social protection and labor contracts, offering a foundation for tailored interventions that enhance worker welfare and productivity within the evolving landscape of the informal labor market.
